# Checkpoint: Save and Restore System State

> Last updated: 07/03/2026

## Overview

TransferQueue provides `tq.save_checkpoint` and `tq.load_checkpoint` to persist and restore the full system state — controller metadata and storage data — enabling fault tolerance and training resumption after a restart.

A checkpoint captures two components:

- **Controller state** — all partition metadata, the global index manager, and sampler state.
- **Storage data** — the tensor and non-tensor field data held by each `SimpleStorageUnit`.

## Quick Start

```python
import transfer_queue as tq

tq.init(config)

# ... put/get data during training ...

# Save at a step boundary
tq.save_checkpoint("/shared/fs/checkpoints/step_1000", metadata={"step": 1000})

# --- After restart ---
tq.init(config)
tq.load_checkpoint("/shared/fs/checkpoints/step_1000")
# System state restored; training can resume
```

## API Reference

### `tq.save_checkpoint`

```python
def save_checkpoint(
    checkpoint_dir: str | Path,
    *,
    include_storage: bool = True,
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> None
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint_dir` | Directory to write the checkpoint. Created if it does not exist. If a checkpoint already exists at this path, it is atomically replaced using a `.tmp` + `.old` mechanism (see [Atomic Checkpoint Replacement](#atomic-checkpoint-replacement)). |
| `include_storage` | Whether to save storage unit data. For `SimpleStorage` (in-memory), this is forced to `True` regardless of the value passed — skipping storage would cause complete data loss on restart. For persistent external backends, `False` is valid. |
| `metadata` | Optional user-defined key-value pairs written into `metadata.json`. Useful for recording step number, timestamp, etc. |

**Raises**: `RuntimeError` if `tq.init()` has not been called, or if any write step fails.

---

### `tq.load_checkpoint`

```python
def load_checkpoint(
    checkpoint_dir: str | Path,
) -> None
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint_dir` | Path to a directory previously written by `save_checkpoint`. |

**Raises**: `FileNotFoundError` if the directory or required files are missing; `ValueError` if the number of storage units in the checkpoint does not match the running system; `RuntimeError` if `tq.init()` has not been called or restore fails.

**Prerequisite**: `tq.init()` must have been called and the system must be in a clean state (no prior data operations). `load_checkpoint` restores state into a running system; it does not launch components.

## Checkpoint Directory Layout

```
checkpoint_dir/
├── metadata.json                        # Flags and user metadata
├── controller_state.pkl                 # Controller state (pickle)
└── simple_storage/
    ├── storage_unit_info.json           # Position-to-ID manifest
    ├── su_0_<id>.pkl                    # StorageUnit at position 0
    ├── su_0_<id>.pkl.blobs/             # Its SSD values, when offload is enabled
    ├── su_1_<id>.pkl                    # StorageUnit at position 1
    ├── su_1_<id>.pkl.blobs/             # Its SSD values, when offload is enabled
    └── ...
```

**`metadata.json`**

```json
{
  "storage_saved": true,
  "user_metadata": {"step": 1000}
}
```

**`storage_unit_info.json`**

```json
[
  {"position": 0, "storage_unit_id": "<id_0>"},
  {"position": 1, "storage_unit_id": "<id_1>"}
]
```

## Atomic Checkpoint Replacement

`save_checkpoint` writes to `<checkpoint_dir>.tmp`, renames the existing `checkpoint_dir` to `<checkpoint_dir>.old`, renames `.tmp` into `checkpoint_dir`, then deletes `.old`. This keeps the old checkpoint recoverable until the new one is fully in place; a failure partway through restores `.old` automatically, and the directory stays a plain folder (no symlink).

POSIX `rename()` can't atomically swap two existing directories, so `checkpoint_dir` is briefly absent between the second and third steps. If the process crashes in that window, `load_checkpoint` detects the missing `checkpoint_dir` with a leftover `.old` and restores it automatically before loading. A concurrent `load_checkpoint` call landing in that same narrow window may see a transient `FileNotFoundError`.

## Architecture

```
tq.save_checkpoint / tq.load_checkpoint
          │
          │  ZMQ RPC
          ├──────────────► TransferQueueController (Ray Actor)
          │                  - partition metadata
          │                  - index_manager state
          │                  - sampler state
          │
          │  ZMQ RPC (concurrent)
          └──────────────► StorageManager
                              ├── SimpleStorageUnit 0  ──► su_0_<id>.pkl
                              ├── SimpleStorageUnit 1  ──► su_1_<id>.pkl
                              └── ...
```

Both the controller and each storage unit write their data directly to disk from within their own processes. The ZMQ RPC carries only the target file path and an ACK, not the payload — this avoids routing large tensors through the Ray object store. With SSD offload enabled, each `su_*.pkl` stores in-memory values plus an `ssd_index` of plain metadata dictionaries; SSD-backed values are copied unchanged into the adjacent `.blobs` directory. Save and load therefore do not materialize the full SSD tier in host memory.

## Save Order and Consistency

The save sequence is: **controller first, storage units second**.

This ordering is intentional. In the normal data flow, a `put` writes to the storage unit before the controller's `production_status` is updated. At any point in time, storage units hold a superset (or equal set) of what the controller considers produced. Snapshotting the controller first therefore guarantees that every index the controller records as produced is present in the subsequently snapshotted storage units.

If storage were snapshotted first, a race could produce a checkpoint where the controller records an index as produced but the corresponding storage data was not yet captured — consumers would read a missing entry on restore.

**Concurrent `clear` during save**: If `clear_partition` or `clear_samples` runs concurrently with `save_checkpoint`, the controller snapshot may reference indexes that are subsequently deleted from storage before the storage snapshot is taken. The resulting checkpoint reflects a mixed view. To avoid this, callers should ensure no concurrent `clear` operations are issued during `save_checkpoint`. In practice, checkpoints are typically taken at step boundaries where no clearing is in progress.

## Multi-Node Requirements

`checkpoint_dir` must reside on a shared filesystem accessible from all nodes (NFS, GPFS, Lustre, etc.), because each StorageUnit writes its file directly to that path. Single-node deployments have no such requirement.

## Storage Unit Count Matching

On load, the number of storage units in the checkpoint must exactly match the running system. The matching is by **position** (index in the ordered list), not by storage unit ID — since IDs are regenerated on each `tq.init()`, position-based matching supports restart with freshly created actors. A count mismatch raises `ValueError` and aborts the restore.

## Known Limitations

### 1. Save consistency is not guaranteed under concurrent clears

See [Save Order and Consistency](#save-order-and-consistency) above. Concurrent `clear_partition` or `clear_samples` during `save_checkpoint` can produce a checkpoint whose controller view references storage entries that no longer exist.

**Workaround**: Do not issue `clear_partition` or `clear_samples` while `save_checkpoint` is running. This is naturally satisfied when checkpointing at training step boundaries.

---

### 2. Load is not transactional — partial restore has no rollback

The load sequence is:

```python
if meta.get("storage_saved"):
    client.load_storage_checkpoint(...)   # (1) storage restored first
client.load_controller_checkpoint(...)    # (2) controller restored second
```

If step (1) partially succeeds and step (2) fails, the system is left in a mixed state: some storage units hold checkpoint data while the controller still reflects its pre-restore state. There is no rollback path.

**Workaround**: If `load_checkpoint` raises, call `tq.init()` again to reset the system to a clean state before retrying.
